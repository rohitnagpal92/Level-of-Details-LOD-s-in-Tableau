# Level of Details (LOD's) in Tableau

Level of Details (LODs) are the complex formulas in Tableau. These are generally used when the data is not in required format and some type of data manipulation is required to acheive the required visulaization.

There are 3 types of LOD's formulas:
1. Include
2. Exclude
3. Fixed

Here, I have attached the both word document and tableau workbook for each type of LOD. In the document, you can find the detailed explanation about why & how to use the LOD and in tableau workbook same example has been done practically as well.

Hope this helps !

Thanks & Regards
